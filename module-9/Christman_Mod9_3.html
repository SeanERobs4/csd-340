        <p>Toy Story Script Excerpt</p>
        <p><span id = "Woody">_____</span>: "Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?" Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof. "Buzz!" Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious. "Buzz! You're alive! This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved! Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.  Huh?" No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare. "Right? Buddy?"</p>
        <p><span id = "Buzz">____</span>: "I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet." Woody: "Oh.  Oh, that's good." Buzz: "But we're not on my planet, are we?" Woody: "No."</p>
        <p>Buzz lunges for Woody. The two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van. Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked in mortal combat. Woody: "Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of me?!" Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around. Woody lunges with all his might. He smacks Buzz in the face, making it SQUEAK with every blow. Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand. "Owwwww!!!" Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating Buzz's Sampled voice buttons. *CAR DOOR SLAM* The toys stop fighting. Before they can react... <span id = "Mrs. Davis">__________</span>: "Next stop..." <span id = "Andy">____</span>: "Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!" The van drives off. Woody: "Andy?!" Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.</p>
